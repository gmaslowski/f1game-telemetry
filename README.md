# Important!

This project evolved quite a bit, but *IS NOT* available anymore under [https://f1telemetry.rocks](https://f1telemetry.rocks), due to time and money reasons.

This project aimed to bring F1 20XX games telemetry data into the cloud:
- to share it with friends
- to view the progress
- to have an online live-experience of telemetry data
- to analyze track times, runs
- and more!

Current state doesn't have all of the features in place, but is a solid base for further development. Please contact me if you'd like to support the development!

### Some movies made during development

*Cannot find unfortunately any screens/movies from the cloud based solution which had accounts and nice UI :(.*
